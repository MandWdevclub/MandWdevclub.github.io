We are now using Jekyll for the Mobile & Web development club! This fixes some issues with inconsistent html updates (e.g. updating the navigation for *all* pages), and we can now allow members to easily add posts & updates!

Other changes:

* Using [Materialize](http://materializecss.com/) for the Flat CSS & Formatting of the site.
* Overhaul of the About Us page, still needs some work (missing images).
* Downloads has been renamed to "Resources".
* Removed the "Help" page. Now address those concerns in main page.
* Embed Google Spreadsheet of meetup events in the meetups page.
* Links to apps (some are still missing).
