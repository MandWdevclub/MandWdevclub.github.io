need to 

The dependencies mac:

brew installation  http://brew.sh/
install from this link

brew install python
(gets pip as well)

open a new terminal window

should have 2.712

pip install flask

stop here, open a terminal
python
import flask


Might need to:
uninstall brew, google uninstall brew mac
 http://www.curvve.com/blog/guides/2013/uninstall-homebrew-mac-osx/
 chown <username> /usr/local   (get username from whoami)
brew prune



iOS: 
xcode from mac app store (press apple button top left corner and press app store), 
https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12


cocoapod (need gems but it should come with it)
sudo gem install cocoapods

####1. Overview

This part of the workshop will be focused on application setup, everyone's favorite part of hacking. Thus, we'll be using digital ocean, because it doesn't come with all the security hassles that AWS enforces. If you're going to be doing production level stuff, then we recommend using AWS or GCP, since they make it difficult to botch initial security group configurations. Let's get started m80s! Oh wait, one more thing, why are we using flask? This workshop is meant for beginners. Flask & python do an incredible job at reducing the mental gymnastics required to get something up and running  without obfuscating too much work that it seems like black magic is happening under the hood. This makes it the perfect choice for you to learn the high level components of server communication with mobile devices. If you would like to know more about how flask works with the operating system, and how you could build your own web framework, then check out this surprisingly short, but incredibly useful network programming guide: http://beej.us/guide/bgnet/output/html/multipage/index.html

Without further adu, let us begin!



####1. Creating the Server & Installing Dependencies

Go to https://www.digitalocean.com and create a 16.04 ubuntu droplet. Digital Ocean will send you the deetz about this server via email so that you can login. 

Now from your local machine, access the server via
```
ssh root@<insert your droplet IP address here>
```

Once you have access to the remote server, let's start installing the python & nginx dependencies via the following ez commands:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3-pip python3-dev nginx
```

This is great, but let's say we also want to have a django application that has a bunch of legacy python packages. Remember kids, always practice safe server side dependency control. How can we isolate our swanky new flask application from the dinosaur django application? We'll use virtualenv. If you're coming from node, then think of this as a heavy duty version of packages.json. Enough talk, run these commands:

```
sudo pip3 install virtualenv
```

To use virtualenv, let's create our application's folder first:

```
mkdir ~/myproject
cd ~/myproject
```

Now let's tell virtualenv to create a new virtual environment, so that it can keep a track of what python dependencies (in this case, pip and python3) belong to which virtual environment (in this case, the virtual environment called "myprojectenv").

```
virtualenv myprojectenv
```

If you check your directory, you'll see that virtualenv created a virtual environment file. You should activate this file using virtualenv before installing the rest of the dependencies by doing:

```
source myprojectenv/bin/activate
```

Great! Simple stuff, eh. 

####2. Flask & uwsgi Configuration
##### 2.1 Flask configuration
Alright, even though you're a 1337 ninja wizard 'rockstar' hacker in my books, we still have a lot of work to do. Let's move on to getting flask, testing it out, and then getting uswgi configured. Let's begin:

```
pip install uwsgi flask
```
(virtualenv will take care of the difference between pip3 and pip if you were wondering)

Now we will actually use the flask web framework to code up an API endpoint, so that we can later run some logic if a mobile app contacts our server at that endpoint. Let's use nano to create the python file which will contain our code that uses flask:

```
nano ~/myproject/myproject.py
```

Now let's put the following python code in this file:

```
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return "<h1 style='color:blue'>Hello There!</h1>"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0')
```

What is happening here? Two things, first let's just look at the following lines:

```
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0')
```

the first thing happening is just defining the namespace for the ```Flask``` package to to use. Then, we tell ```app``` to run with the local hostname, which is always gonna be '0.0.0.0' for the ubuntu operating system. Now let's look at the other part.

```
@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return "<h1 style='color:blue'>Hello There!</h1>"
```

This is a bit stranger looking. However, let's break it down. The '@' is part of python, and it is just a shorthand notation for decorators. Basically, the decorator here creates a flask route '/', and links this route with a function to run when that route is accessed. To read more about python and decorators, see here: https://realpython.com/blog/python/primer-on-python-decorators/

Now that we have that covered, let's test it out. First let's get rid of some pesky firewalls for port 5000:

```
sudo ufw allow 5000
```

Now, what we've all been waiting for, run it:

```
python myproject.py
```

Then you can access this application running on your server by using a browser like so:

```
http://server_domain_or_IP:5000
```

A big blue hello world should show up. If it didn't, throw your hands in the air and let an instructor know. Assuming it did, we can go back to our terminal and terminate the python program via ctrl-c

##### 2.2 uwsgi Configuration

I don't know about you, but that was way too exciting for me, let's slow it down a bit. Now we'll configure uwsgi to work with our flask application.
