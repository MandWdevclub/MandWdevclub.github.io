Want to post about something cool you've done to the site? Now you can!

You'll need a GitHub account to add a post, so if you don't already have a GitHub account go ahead and make one.

## Fork the repo

1. Visit the repository for this site: [https://github.com/MandWdevclub/MandWdevclub.github.io](https://github.com/MandWdevclub/MandWdevclub.github.io)
2. Click on the "Fork" button in the top right
  * This just makes a copy of the repository so you commit changes to it.
3. Clone the forked repository

## Create a new post

1. Create a new file in the `_posts` directory.
  * Try to follow the same format, e.g. `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post-here.md`.
2. Add the frontmatter (stuff at the top) in the correct format
  * The "title" will be your posts main title.
  * The "author" should be your name / alias.
  * The "headerImg" and "headingTextColor" attributes are optional. It is just there for some pizazz should you want that in your post.
3. Below the frontmatter, type out your post! (markdown, see below).

## Add Content

These posts will all use markdown to help with article formatting. For a basic intro on this, take a look [here](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/).

## Commit, Push, PR

Once you've made your new post, you will want to commit it (`git commit -am 'what you did'`'), push it to GitHub (`git push`), and then visit GitHub where you can make a Pull Request (PR) from your repository.
